Here's a rough procedure you can use to tackle a coding challenge.  Feel free to mix and match, add or skip steps.  This is just a place to get started.

0) Understand the question, rephrase it until you get it.

1) Write the problem in short non-confusing english sentences. The more and the shorter the better.  In general this will bring your english closer to pseudocode and make the transition to coding simpler.

2) Make a little list of anything that could be mesured or counted.  These will become the list of potentially important variables you'll need to include in your solution.

3) Describe the possible types of inputs. i.e Even or Odd. String, Integer, or undefined. etc.    

4) Write down some input/output pairs that cover all the types of inputs you can expect.

5) Create a skeletal function (all necessary variables declared, return value, args, ...) filled with your short senteces where the logic would go.

6) Refactor your sentences, replacing them with javascript one at a time as they look like something you know how to code.  Repeat

7) Once it works, enter optional refactor phase.
