Franklyn decides the following:
"Fuck coding, I'm going to become a magician"

After 2 weeks he returns to show off his magic act.
Nisha volunteers for his act.

He places Nisha into a box and cuts the box into 3 pieces.
He switches the tail ends to show that the box has been cut into pieces.

Franklyn's act failed miserably, if we act quick we might be able to save Nisha.

Write a function that takes Nisha's feet, torso and head and puts them back in the
correct order: head, torso, feet.

It should take other inputs as well. Just switch the first item in the array with
the third.

console.log(switcheroo(['Feet','Torso','Head']))
// outputs [ 'Head', 'Torso', 'Feet' ]
console.log(switcheroo(['Last item', 'Center item', 'First item' ]))
// outputs [ 'First item', 'Center item', 'Last item' ]
