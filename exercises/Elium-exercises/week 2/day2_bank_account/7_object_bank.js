/*

In order to prepare you more for this weekâ€™s project,
we're going to add an extra layer of complexity to the bank app.

Let's keep the functions in the global scope for aesthetic reasons.

Re-write your showBalance function to accommodate the new structure.
If the name entered doesn't exist, give an error message saying 'User does not exist'
