principles:
	- big picutre drives planning, don't get caught up in or driven off course by implementations
	- distinguish between features and core
	- think in terms of user behavior 
	- think in terms of data management
	- the app is the structure, not the implementation
	- development is not coding, it's efficeintly creating automated solutions run over the internet.
	why write from scratch when wordpress will do?
