so how do design an application from scratch:  data + interaction

	-0) what data will the app be storing and manipulating?
			beaver accounts {name, age, sex, spottedhistory, tracked, ...}
		What interactiosn do you want it to support?
			a user can CRUD these beaver records

	Your development decisions follow from satisfying these initial design decisions.
	
	procedure:
		So let's try this out with this week's prompt:
			0.1) write all the user stories you want to have
			0.2) sort them by dependancy
			0.3) choose the core and proceed
			1) draw a wireframe with all the interactions you want
				(untrack all, add beaver, add location, track/untrack single, ... for that core)
			2) let's draw a model of our data and wireframe as per apps0
			3) let's make the mvc chart for this core
			3.1) and make the diagram for this as per apps0
			3.2) make another diagram that adds on next deployment feature
			3. ... ) have the whole 'deployment schedule'
			4) Code it!
